###  Streams

*  A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.

The features of Java stream are –

*  A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.

* Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
* Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
